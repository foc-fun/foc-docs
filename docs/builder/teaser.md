import { FocBuilder } from '@foc/builder';

const builder = new FocBuilder();

// Visual contract creation
const token = await builder.createContract('ERC20')
  .setName('MyToken')
  .setSymbol('MTK')
  .addFeature('mintable')
  .addFeature('pausable')
  .addFeature('upgradeable')
  .generate();

// One-click deployment
const deployment = await builder.deploy(token, {
  network: 'testnet',
  verify: true
});

// Instant UI generation
const ui = await builder.generateUI(deployment, {
  theme: 'dark',
  components: ['transfer', 'balance', 'admin']
});
```
